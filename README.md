# AspNetCore.Authorization.Permissions

A libary that add permission-based authorization.

The ASP.NET Core role-based authorization in combination with custom authorization policies
is a good starting point for restricting users' access in an application, but it is very 
static and changes to the meaning of a role or a policy forces you to perform changes in 
your code and to re-deploy your application. This library aims to overcome this limitation.
